Dog age calculator for iOS
Age of Laika is an iOS app for calculating the age of your dog.
Most people believe that to calculate your dog's age in equivalent human years just multiply by seven.
But this does not account for the rapid growth of young years.

Age of Laika is based on a more sophisticated algorithm that takes into account the more rapid aging during your dog's younger years.
For comparison's sake, by the time a male dog is 3 years old, he is the equivalent, in human years, of 21 years old. But after that his aging slows down to four human years to one dog year.
